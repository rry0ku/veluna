# Cut a signed release: publish the tag with an empty updater manifest, start the three CI builds,
# build the .rpm locally while they run, then wait and verify the whole thing landed.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. The release is created and every workflow is dispatched BEFORE the local rpm
# build, not after: CI's ~15 minutes and this machine's ~5 minutes then overlap instead of queueing.
# The rpm is uploaded to the already-published release afterwards. The cost of that ordering is that
# a failed rpm build leaves a published release with no rpm on it, recoverable with one
# `gh release upload`, and the script tells you the exact command if it happens.
#
# Neither the AppImage nor the .deb is built here, and for the same reason: both inherit their
# build host's glibc floor, and this machine is Fedora (the newest glibc in existence), so one built
# here starts nowhere else. The deb is the worse of the two, because Tauri writes its Depends
# verbatim from tauri.conf.json and never emits a libc6 constraint: a Fedora-built deb installs
# cleanly on Debian and then dies at startup on a missing GLIBC symbol. Both are built by
# .github/workflows/linux-release.yml on a pinned ubuntu-24.04 runner, which also attaches them,
# adds the linux-x86_64 entry to latest.json and marks the release "Latest". Windows and macOS do
# the same for their own entries. So this script publishes the release NOT-latest on purpose: until
# CI has attached the binaries, the updater endpoint (.../releases/latest/download/latest.json)
# keeps resolving to the previous, complete manifest instead of one with no platforms in it.
#
# Usage:  scripts/release.sh ["release notes"]
# Bump "version" in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json AND Cargo.toml BEFORE running (tauri.conf.json is the
# app version the updater compares against; the preflight below refuses to run if they disagree).
#
# Requires: the private signing key at ~/.tauri/veluna.key, `gh` authed, jq, curl.
